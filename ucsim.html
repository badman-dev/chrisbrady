                    <p><strong>Professional Unity Development<br/>Since September 2021</strong></p>
                    <p>I work as a Unity Generalist at <a href="https://ucsim.uc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Cincinnati's Center for Simulations & Virtual Environments Research</a>.</p>
                    <p>At UC Sim we work primarily in Unity and mostly on AR/VR applications. The projects I've worked on have 
                      been diverse in purpose, including areas such as industrial training, immersive storytelling, visualization, and research.</p>
                    <p>As a small studio, our roles are less specific, so I've had the opportunity to work different aspects of game development, focusing largely on technical design and programming.</p>

                  <h3>Tri-State Trails Newport VR Experience</h3>
                  <h4>Urban Infrastructure VR Visualization</h4>
                  <p>Working with the organization Tri-State Trails for feedback, I acted as the sole developer on this project, pitching the original design and realizing it within Unity over the course of 2 months.</p>
                  <p>The simulation itself is a VR visualization of proposed changes to the city of Newport, KY in order to better accomodate bicyclists and pedestrians. As such, it presents the player 
                    with a before/after of the area surrounding the intersection of <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fUoxoFiUNJSHNkeq7" target="_blank">Saratoga St. and 3rd St.</a></p>
                  <p>I modeled out the scene using a combination of modular assets, buildboarding, and self-created building models made using the RealtimeCSG package for Unity. 
                    The environment was accurately recreated using Google Streetview and my own personal knowledge of Newport. I added basic animation of vehicles along a scripted timeline handled by my own code.</p>
                  <p>When the project was complete, we brought it to the <a href="https://www.midwestsustainabilitysummit.org/" target="_blank">Midwest Sustainability Summit</a> to present at a booth, presenting the simulation on a Vive Focus 3 standalone headset.</p>

                    <h4>VR Driving Chassis Simulation</h4>
                    <p>This project was a non-billable project that UC Sim uses to demonstrate our tools and development abilities to potential clients. It is a three minute long driving sandbox complete with traffic simulation.</p>
                    <p>My involvement in the project was in creating the city level for which people would drive through, using modular city art assets. The level is built to be imageable and leave an impression on players of a real place. 
                      There are a number of landmarks and meaningful connecting paths, all dense enough to be experienced in the limited time of the simulation.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I spent time scripting the traffic simulation using a third-party Unity package. This involved me defining usable routes for vehicles and scripting intersections.</p>

                  <h3>Hope After Hate</h3>
                  <h4>Immersive VR Storytelling</h4>
                  <p>HAH is a VR experience that tells the story of holocaust survivor Moniek Lipszyc. Players 
                    follow Moniek through scenes of his life that capture the tragedy of hate and bigotry, with 
                    the intention of inspiring players against hate in our modern world.</p>
                  <p>The simulation is mostly linear, but since each scene is a recreation of a real-world space, there is room for exploration. 
                    Each space is full 3D video viewers that show players what each location looks like today.</p>
                  <p>I was originally brought on for QA, but had the opportunity to redesign one of the levels in order to increase player engagement and direction.</p>

                    <h4>Human Behavioral Research</h4>
                    <p>This project is not a standalone playable experience, and instead is a set of tools we develop for the Center of Cognition and Perception lab to allow non-developers to create VR experiments to study human behavior.</p>
                    <p>A primary feature of this framework are our "behaviors" which create provide test subjects with asymmetric information. In example, two 
                      subjects might have to cooperate on a task involving grabbable objects, but each might be seeing different objects, which affects their coordination.</p>
                    <p>My part in this project has largely been programming the tools, but I've also been involved in creating demo experiments to ease our clients into the tools.</p>

                  <h4>Immersive Desktop Storytelling</h4>
                  <p>MCarES is a trio of empathy-building simulations that tell the stories of troubled individuals as they seek health care, 
                    made to be played by health care providers.</p>
                  <p>I primarily worked on the Homeless Adult simulation, but also assisted in the Transgender Care and Transition From Pediatric to Adult Care simulations.</p>
                  <p>The application was developed in Unity for non-gamers, and as such is optimized for lower hardware, built for WebGL, and features streamlined design.</p>
                  <p>My work was primarily with sequencing linear levels and bug fixing.</p>

                    <h4>VRChat Art Demonstration</h4>
                    <p>This project involved the implementation of an motion-captured improv performance into a VRChat level.</p>
                    <p>I worked on this project as the only Unity developer, working with a 3D artist. My 
                      work involved porting the original level to VRChat SDK 3.0, implementing assets, and 
                      creating tools for the animation to be viewed in-game.</p>
