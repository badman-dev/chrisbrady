                    <h2>Other Projects</h2>
                    <p>This is the page for various other level design projects where I didn't think a breakdown was necessary. There is also a small game I coded.</p>
                    <p>I'm still proud of these projects, but the level design ones are more 
                      valuable for showing how far I've come since I first started. Many of these were before I had a sure aspiration of level design as a profession. 
                      My earliest taking part in level design goes back to middle school when I made Roblox bases for clans, and even once I started using
                      Hammer I was creating a lot less than great levels.</p>
                    <p>A huge part of my progress as a designer has been through the simple trial and error of creation, and I wouldn't be where I am without 
                      years of mapping.</p>

                  <h3>Coast Train</h3>
                  <h4>Garry's Mod Ragdoll Combat</h4>
                  <p>Ragdoll Combat is a slapstick platform fighter gamemode made for Garry's Mod that my friends and I like to play, but there's a severe lack of actual maps for it 
                    so I created this to induldge in all the things I liked about the gamemode and that I believed would bring more laughter out of my friends.</p>
                    <p>The map is full of hazards that will 
                    catapult players around, my favorites being two lanes of trains that race across opposing tracks and a platform that launches players upward when they ragdoll over it.</p>
                  <p>If you have Garry's Mod, get some friends together and get the map <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2640412465" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                    <h4>Javascript Game</h4>
                    <p>This project was started as part of a Javascript class I was taking at the time. Originally the goal was to create a minimalist god game, ala Black and White, inside an HTML canvas with Javascript, but 
                      after giving the characters the ability to mate and reproduce I noticed how quickly they'd flood the screen and generate abstract art in real-time, and ended up changing gear to leverage that.</p>
                    <p>I really enjoyed creating a game that operates entirely on systems rather than deliberate direction, and I'd like to work on a similar coding project once I have the time.</p>
                    <p>Play it <a href="https://badman-dev.github.io/god-game/" target="_blank">here</a> and check out the code <a href="https://github.com/badman-dev/god-game" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                  <h3>Colorland</h3>
                  <h4>Counter Strike: GO Capture Point</h4>
                  <p>Made for a short-lived custom gamemode created by mapper and youtuber 3kilksphilip, Colorland and its Control Point gamemode is built similar to Conquest in games like Battlefield, though instead it features 
                    two middle points that a team must control in order to push into the enemy's home base and win.</p>
                  <p>Imageability and readability is very explicitly strong due to the usage of color coded textures, which define the area surrounding each control point and the home base of each team.</p>
                  <p>It was featured by the gamemode's creator in a video here <a href="https://youtu.be/hgUdWWJD_wQ" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                    <h4>Counter Strike: GO</h4>
                    <p>An experimental map that went through both a dev texture and art-passed release, Mogwai explores what CSGO would play like if it broke it's 3-lane rule and was allowed open space and verticality.</p>
                    <p>This map supports all the original CSGO gamemodes, though it is most fun to play in Deathmatch.</p>

                  <h3>Isol</h3>
                  <h4>Garry's Mod Trouble in Terrorist Town</h4>
                  <p>Made for the traitor game, TTT, Isol is an open-ended level that takes place on a surreal island. Atop the island are bizzare ruins of stone and wood, but beneath its surface lies a buried modern, urban street.</p>
                  <p>The map features a tester that players can use to prove their innocence, positioned in site of a sniper tower. Exploring the underground tunnels can lead 
                    players to a building that can't otherwise be accessed from outside unless unlocked from within.</p>
                  <p>The map features many interconnected spaces and rewards exploration. There are a handful of dead ends that serve as defensible spaces, particularly useful for "overtime rules", 
                    which are commonly accepted on TTT servers and allow players to claim "kill on site" rules in certain spaces.</p>
                  <p>A while back I detailed the design more in-depth <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aU0VnPMSPCuvpoLhOO0zA8H9Qd3pXmq-EG37Y4pjoYQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                    <h3>Neatstreet</h3>
                    <h4>Garry's Mod Trouble in Terrorist Town</h4>
                    <p>A smaller TTT map that I began in early high school and came back to finish after graduation, Neatstreet takes place in a small urban street full of individual buildings and gardens.</p>
                    <p>Fitting to my love for spiral shortcut design, this map also features an underground space that can lead to an otherwise inaccessible area. It also features a small basketball court that players 
                      can roughly play and score with using ball props.</p>
