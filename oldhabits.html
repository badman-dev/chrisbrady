                  <h2>Design and Process</h2>
                  <p>Inspired by the wide-linear mission design of Arkane games that allow players to tackle set tasks in their own way, and the layered, exploratory, and shortcut-full design of FromSoftware games like Dark Souls, I set out to create a full Thief 2 level, from conception to release.</p>
                  <h3>Layout Design</h3>
                  <p>Before I jumped into the editor I drafted up layout concepts on graph paper. I had a process of paper designing portions of the level, 
                  implementing them in-game, testing the level up to that point, iterating on these portions, and repeating. Though the fundamental concepts are still there, 
                  there was significant alteration in response to testing feedback.</p>
                  <p>Check out a PDF of my paper plans/notes <a href="pdf/oldhabitspaperdrafts.pdf" target="_blank" download>here</a>.</p>
                  <p>Players are regularly given choices in navigating, but are nudged in certain directions by locked doors and one-way routes. Objectives involve backtracking, which is made easier by unlockable shortcuts and stealth advantages.
                  Fueled by my recent reading of Kevin Lynch's <i>Image of the City</i>, imageability was a major goal. The level features a series of landmarks and memorable paths to help players 
                  maintain an understanding of where they are. Until the layout was finalized, all playtesting was done without any in-game map to ensure it was not needed.</p>
                  <h3>Gameplay Design</h3>
                  <p>Implemented as parts of the layout were completed, gameplay involved stealth interactions with enemy NPCs, using opportunistic navigation tools, puzzle solving, treasure collecting, and special objectives.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty of each area varied depending on the place in relation to objectives, which was integrated contextually into the worldbuilding.</p>
                  <p>Players must both break into a vault in the mansion that requires a key from the back garden and find a doll in the abandoned house past the mansion. These objectives lead the player to all four major areas of the level.</p>
                  <p>Optional objectives include gathering resources in the mansion basement to craft a key to a safe, collecting two hints to crack a code lock located out front of the mansion, and gathering various bits of loot around the whole level.</p>
                  <h3>Playtesting</h3>
                  <p>Throughout the course of this project, I had ten different testers. Testers included one professional level designer, 
                  one Thief fan level designer, three long-time Thief fans, and five players who where completely new to Thief.</p>
                  <p>Having testers with varying experience gave me access to a wider variety of feedback. Testers were introduced at different stages of 
                  development to ensure I regularly had players going in blind. I observed every gameplay test and took detailed notes.</p>
                  <p>Towards the end, I had a several week period of comprehensive QA-testing from several players and bug fixing.</p>
