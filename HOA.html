                    <h3>Half Life 2 Singleplayer</h3>
                    <p><strong>FPS, Scripted Setpieces, Systemic Gameplay<br/>1 Month Solo Project<br/>Released February 21st, 2024</strong></p>
                    <p>HOA Violation is an action-heavy Half-Life 2 level in which the player breaks free of a smoke-and-mirrors simulation, finding themselves in a Combine facility that they have to shoot their way out of.</p>
                    <p>This level was made for level designer <a href="https://doublefunction.co.uk/" target="_blank">Steve Lee</a>'s seventh level design jam (found <a href="https://itch.io/jam/ld-jam-7" target="_blank">here</a>), which had the theme of "A Surprise". 
                      In the spirit of the jam, this level takes advantage of engine quirks to feature a non-euclidean twist.</p>

                  <h2>Design</h2>
                  <p>For the "surprise" concept of the jam, I created a level built around an initial plot twist that explodes into FPS action. The twist, inspired by the intro to Arkane's Prey, is
                    that the fully 3D suburb visible around the player's home is fake, and they are instead being watched through one-way glass by the inhabitants of a massive sci-fi facility.
                  </p>
                  <p>I didn't paper draft the layout prior to implementation, however I did originally plan the level in written format by detailing the sequence of events that the player experiences. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The level was playtested by three other level designers and another three friends familiar with Half-Life 2. Testers submitted videos that I was able to watch to observe player behavior.
                    The level underwent a wide variety of changes, both big and small, in response to this playtesting.
                  </p>
                  <p>You can see my original plan and testing notes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyDbKHb4RqeuaL7erqvQwgqlDbhmrvGNKcGyVh0COOc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                  <h3>Built for Combat</h3>
                  <p>Half-Life 2 features robust, systemic NPC enemies. As such, adding appropriate complexity and AI hint nodes to the combat rooms created a level of dynamism that is highly responsive to the player's 
                    moment-to-moment decision making. Enemies take cover, throw grenades, shoot through glass, and attempt to flank the player, to name a few.
                  </p>
                  <p>In one example of a puzzle, a hole in the ground is covered in wooden boards. Above this is a catwalk storage area that has old appliances such as a fridge and a washing machine. 
                    In order to enter the hole, players must shatter the wooden boards by pushing one of these heavy objects off the catwalk and sending them crashing through the boards.
                  </p>
                  <p>As another example, in order to escape and complete the level, players must get a car out of the garage. The garage doors are barred shut by a piece of metal, which works entirely by the game's physics. 
                    In order to unlock the piece the player needs to obtain the game's signature "gravity gun" to lift the piece of metal and unbar the door.
                  </p>
                  <p>My original concept for the level was more focused on puzzles and I did some prototyping of this before settling on a version that incorporated Half Life 2's enemies and weapons, 
                    believing that they added more opportunity for exciting scripting scenarios.</p>
                  <h3>Scripting</h3>
                  <p>The level makes heavy use of scripted sequences involving different types of AI. The general goal of using scripted sequences was to introduce enemies into spaces that the player 
                    was already in, and to create a sense of escalation as the combine raid the house.</p>
                  <p>The sequences begin with the Combine sending shells full of headcrabs to zombify the rebels,
                    then continues to them sending in manhack drones to scout the area, before finally sending in the soldiers to clear out what's left.
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of the sequences are small scale, like having a headcrab walk a certain path to tease the player, while others are larger scale like enemies ambushing the player by
                     shooting up windows and breaching rooms by blowing doors off of their hinges.</p>
                  <p>Outside of what I specifically scripted, the AI have different systemic behaviors, like taking cover or infighting between different factions (combine, zombies, etc.).</p>
                  <p>There's also some non-AI scripting, such as a bit where the player must restore power in a flooded basement, which in turn electrifies the water, creating a hazard.</p>
