                    <p><strong>FPS, Open World, Movement Shooter, Exploration, Boss Fights<br/>Released September 24th, 2024</strong></p>
                    <p>I worked with Greylock Studio on the launch version of Echo Point Nova and am currently working on post-launch content.</p>
                    <p>As one of two level designers, I was responsible for creating a portion of the zones in the open world in between major combat zones, as well as two of the four major bosses.</p>
                    <p>I also assisted in adjustments to existing zones and testing.</p>

                  <h3>Speed Zones</h3>
                  <p>In order to bridge space between major combat zones, "speed zones" exist as fast, exciting, and largely linear movement challenges. They sometimes included small skirmishes and collectables, but, for pacing reasons, were always less intense than major combat zones.</p>
                  <p>Player movement abilities include horizontal wall riding, vertical wall riding, double/triple jumping, grappling, vertical wind boosts, and a number of other ways to influence radically variable movement speeds. The speed variability of EPN is more comparable to something like <a href="https://youtu.be/5BnP99WNtEc?si=H82TkbxkRHJgBh-i" target="_blank">Source Engine Bunny Hopping</a> than traditional platforming that may cap movement speeds.</p>
                  <p>All movement abilities were considered when designing, though difficulty on speed zones are tuned so that low skill players can still complete them with whatever in-game abilities they should have unlocked at the given moment. The inverse to this is that high skill players get a sense of empowerment when they move fast enough to zoom past platforms that low skill players may depend on (Which is also true in the aforementioned bunny hopping).</p>
                  <p>Due to players' extreme movement capabilities, any deliberately designed platforming can be skipped if the player has enough momentum. Agility orbs, the most common collectable, were placed in speed zones as rewards for precise parkour, as a means of encouraging players to engage in the platforming challenges.</p>
                  <p>Certain visual motifs are established through repetition in order to <i>suggest</i> certain movement options to players, such as ramped terrain for boarding off of or glowing poles to suggest grappling (even though the player can grapple any surface).</p>
                  <p>To accommodate player freedom in the open world, each speed zone was designed to be interesting to move through from whatever direction. In scenarios with significant height differences, platforms that suggest usage for one particular direction are sometimes used, such as ones that encourage the player to both ride on top of, or grapple the bottom of.</p>

                  <h4>VR Historical Tour</h4>
                  <p>Working with Altafiber directly, I led development on a ~4 minute VR experience made for visitors to Altafiber's headquarters in Cincinnati.</p>
                  <p>The experience featured 3 vignettes of the company's history, all assembled by myself with original modelling, sourced models, sourced and edited audio, and original scripting/programming.</p>
                  <p>Both UI and environmental interactions are handled via handtracking as the user does not use traditional VR controllers. The experience runs directly on a Meta Quest 3</p>
                  <p>I performed most of the in-editor work on this project, and handled the majority of the creative decision making and problem solving after the original script was produced by other team members.</p>

                  <h4>Augmented Reality Marketing Experience</h4>
                  <p>Working with UC and P&G, we produced an augmented reality experience for the rebranding of their Digital Accelerator lab at the 1819 Innovation Hub in Cincinnati.</p>
                  <p>I was involved in gathering site data, designing the layout of the experience, implementing visuals, and debugging.</p>

                    <h4>VR Driving Chassis Simulation</h4>
                    <p>This project was a non-billable project that UC Sim uses to demonstrate our tools and development abilities to potential clients. It is a three minute long driving sandbox complete with traffic simulation.</p>
                    <p>My involvement in the project was in creating the city level for which people would drive through, using modular city art assets. The level is built to be imageable and leave an impression on players of a real place. 
                      There are a number of landmarks and meaningful connecting paths, all dense enough to be experienced in the limited time of the simulation.</p>
                    <p>In addition, I spent time scripting the traffic simulation using a third-party Unity package. This involved me defining usable routes for vehicles and scripting intersections.</p>

                  <h4>Immersive VR Storytelling</h4>
                  <p>HAH is a VR experience that tells the story of holocaust survivor Moniek Lipszyc. Players 
                    follow Moniek through scenes of his life that capture the tragedy of hate and bigotry, with 
                    the intention of inspiring players against hate in our modern world.</p>
                  <p>The simulation is mostly linear, but since each scene is a recreation of a real-world space, there is room for exploration. 
                    Each space is full 3D video viewers that show players what each location looks like today.</p>
                  <p>I was originally brought on for QA, but had the opportunity to redesign one of the levels in order to increase player engagement and direction.</p>

                    <h4>Human Behavioral Research</h4>
                    <p>This project is not a standalone playable experience, and instead is a set of tools we developed for the Center of Cognition and Perception lab to allow non-developers to create VR experiments to study human behavior.</p>
                    <p>A primary feature of this framework are our "behaviors" which create provide test subjects with asymmetric information. In example, two 
                      subjects might have to cooperate on a task involving grabbable objects, but each might be seeing different objects, which affects their coordination.</p>
                    <p>My part in this project was largely in programming the tools, but I was also involved in creating demo experiments to ease our clients into the tools.</p>
